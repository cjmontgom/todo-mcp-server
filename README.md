# MCP Task Manager – Educational React Client

An educational full-stack project that extends a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) task-manager server with a React front-end that teaches MCP concepts hands-on. The React app acts as an MCP client, exposing **Resources**, **Tools**, and **Prompts** in a single UI with in-app explanations. [AG Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/) is the primary way tabular data is displayed, making this simultaneously a learning exercise for both MCP and AG Grid.

- **MCP Server** (`src/`) — TypeScript/Node, STDIO transport. Exposes Resources, Tools, and Prompts for task management with deadlines.
- **HTTP/SSE Proxy** (`proxy/`) — Spawns the MCP server as a subprocess and bridges it to the browser over HTTP + Server-Sent Events.
- **React App** (`client/`) — MCP client UI with AG Grid as the primary data presentation layer, educational copy, and a natural-language chat interface.

## Start Everything

First, build the MCP server (required once, or after server changes):

```bash
npm run build
```

Then start all three processes in parallel:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs:
| Process | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| MCP Server | — | Runs via STDIO (spawned by proxy) |
| HTTP/SSE Proxy | `http://localhost:3001` | Bridges browser ↔ MCP server |
| React Client | `http://localhost:5173` | Educational MCP client UI |

## Individual Start Commands

Run each in a separate terminal if you prefer:

```bash
# Terminal 1 – MCP server (STDIO, consumed by proxy)
npm run start

# Terminal 2 – HTTP/SSE proxy
npm run dev --prefix proxy

# Terminal 3 – React client
npm run dev --prefix client
```

## What This Project Covers

### MCP Concepts (taught through the UI)

| Concept | How it's exposed |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Resources** | Read-only data by URI — list and read in the Resources panel; results shown in AG Grid |
| **Tools** | Actions with JSON Schema inputs — fill a schema-driven form and call; state changes confirmed with educational copy |
| **Prompts** | Pre-built messages the server returns — invoke with optional arguments; results shown in AG Grid |
| **Transport** | STDIO for native clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor); HTTP/SSE for the browser via proxy |

### MCP Server Capabilities

**Resources**

| URI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `task://all` | All tasks as JSON |
| `task://summary` | Task statistics summary (text) |
| `task://table/all` | All tasks as a markdown table |
| `task://table/by-deadline` | Tasks sorted by due date |
| `task://table/by-priority` | Tasks sorted by priority |
| `task://table/priority-then-deadline` | Tasks sorted by priority, then due date |
| `task://open` | Only todo and in-progress tasks |

**Tools**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create_task` | Add a task with title, description, priority, and optional due date |
| `update_task` | Update any task field (title, description, status, priority, dueDate) |
| `get_task` | Retrieve details for a single task |
| `delete_task` | Remove a task |

**Prompts**

| Prompt | Arguments | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `tasks_table` | `sort` (deadline \| priority \| priority-then-deadline) | Markdown table of tasks |
| `tasks_summary_for_stakeholders` | — | Counts by status, overdue tasks |
| `completions_by_date` | `from`, `to` (optional) | Completed tasks by date |

### AG Grid Learning

Every panel in the React app uses AG Grid to display tabular data (from Resources, Tools, and Prompts) with client-side sort and filter — so you practise AG Grid column defs, data binding, and multiple data sources alongside MCP concepts.

### Natural Language Chat

A chat interface lets you type plain-language requests ("show me overdue tasks sorted by priority"). The proxy interprets the request via a local LLM (Ollama, `http://localhost:11434` by default) and selects the appropriate MCP operation, which the app executes and displays in AG Grid with an explanation of what capability was used and why.

Configure the LLM via proxy environment variables:

```bash
LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434   # Ollama default
LLM_MODEL=llama3                      # or any Ollama model
```

## Configure with Claude Desktop

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "task-manager": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/todo-mcp-server/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/absolute/path/to/` with your actual path. The server uses STDIO transport and is fully compatible with any MCP host.

## Setup

```bash
# Clone and install root dependencies (MCP server + concurrently)
npm install

# Install proxy dependencies
npm install --prefix proxy

# Install React client dependencies
npm install --prefix client

# Build the MCP server
npm run build

# Start everything
npm run dev
```

## Key Learnings

1. **MCP separates concerns**: Resources are read-only data by URI; Tools are actions with schema-validated inputs; Prompts are pre-built server-generated messages.
2. **Transport is pluggable**: STDIO for native clients, HTTP/SSE for browsers (via proxy).
3. **Schema-driven UIs**: Tool input schemas can drive form generation directly in the client.
4. **AG Grid patterns**: Column defs, multiple data sources, client-side sort/filter — practised across every panel.
5. **LLM + MCP**: An LLM can interpret natural language and select MCP operations, acting as a reasoning layer on top of a structured protocol.
